There are multiple methods to install these dependencies, and the user should choose the one that best fits their system.
Please refer to the respective websites for installation instructions.

### Conda environment

For ease of use, a [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment file is provided in the [conda-environment.yml](https://github.com/comorment/ldpred2_standalone/blob/main/conda-environment.yml) in this repository.

To create a new Conda environment with the required dependencies, issue in the terminal:

```
conda env create -f conda-environment.yml
conda activate ldpred2_standalone
```

To obtain Conda, please refer to the [Conda installation instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

## Obtaining these files

## Description of available containers

* ``ldpred2.sif`` - a minimal Singularity container with R and RStudio based on [rocker/r-ver](https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/r-ver.html), [Python](https://python.org) with some common numerics and plotting packages, [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/) version 1.9 and 2.0, and [PRSice-2](https://choishingwan.github.io/PRSice/), and dependencies for running PGS using [LDpred2](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/LDpred2.html).

## Using

Please refer to the scripts and README files in the [scripts](https://github.com/comorment/ldpred2_standalone/tree/main/scripts/) directory for usage

## Software versions

This [table](https://github.com/comorment/ldpred2_standalone/tree/main/docker#ldpred2sif) contains the list of tools included in the different Dockerfile(s) and installer bash scripts for each container.
Please keep up to date when pushing new container builds:

## Pulling/Building/rebuilding containers

For instructions on how to build or rebuild containers using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io) or [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org) refer to [`<ldpred2_standalone>/docker/README.md`](https://github.com/comorment/ldpred2_standalone/blob/main/docker/README.md).

## Build the documentation

Within this repository, the html-documentation can be built from source files put here using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html). 
To do so, install Sphinx and some additional packages in Python using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) by issuing:

```
cd <ldpred2_standalone>/docs/source
conda env create -f environment.yml  # creates environment "sphinx"
conda activate sphinx  # activates environment "sphinx
make html  # builds html documentation into _build/html/ subdirectory
```

The built documentation can be viewed locally in a web browser by opening the file
`<ldpred2_standalone>/docs/source/_build/html/index.html`

The documentation may also be hosted online on [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org).

## SLURM job script example

A basic job script example for running a Singularity container in an HPC setting with the [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com) job scheduler is provided in the file [singularity_slurm_job.sh](https://github.com/comorment/ldpred2_standalone/blob/main/scripts/singularity_slurm_job.sh), and should be modified as needed.
It expects a few environment variables and can be submitted as

```
export JOBNAME=ldpred2_standalone
export ACCOUNT=<project allocation account name>
export WALLTIME="00:05:00"  # expected run time HH:MM:SS format
export CPUS_PER_TASK=1  # number of CPU cores
export MEM_PER_CPU=2000MB  # RAM per CPU
export SINGULARITY_MODULE=singularity/3.7.1  # name of Singularity module and version

sbatch singularity_slurm_job.sh  # submit job
```
The output of the job will be written to the text files `ldpred2_standalone.out` (output) and `ldpred2_standalone.err` (errors).
